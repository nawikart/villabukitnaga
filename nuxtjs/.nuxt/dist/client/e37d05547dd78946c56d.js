And its staff, perfection. Every year a group of family and friends spend the Christmas/New Years holiday in a different location. Last year we chose Bali. After much research I choose Villa Bukit Naga. What a great choice. This is the type of home which would appear in Architectural Digest. The rooms are huge. The infinity pool is so beautiful, especially at night overlooking a large ravine, with all the trees and stars and the croaking frogs and quiet drums from the Hindi Temple on the other side. Magical. This villa can easily accommodate 13 persons. The grounds are huge, with little patios here and there, a bale by the main pool and another down a garden path and next to a Hindu Shrine. And flowers everywhere. Small and sometimes very large offerings to the Gods are put out each morning."),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v("\n      The staff are first class. We have stayed at many villas and none come even close to the professional care you will receive at VBN. The house manager, Parta, is available 24/7. He will also drive you into Ubud, or anywhere you would like to go. He is an excellent tour guide. The professional cook, Putu, is also excellent. Any type of meal you would like, she will prepare. We asked for a special Christmas Day feast. Something Balinese. The staff began preparing 2 days before, making flower arangements, and hand woven grass and flower strands to hang from the pool side bale. The evening of the dinner we came out to find dozens of organic tea candles surrounding the pool, twinkle lights in all the trees and a Bale transformed into a magical vision. The 8 dish dinner was incredible. To complete the event, Parta had arranged for two girls from the village to perform several traditional dances to live music. Unbelievable! All the family members of the staff and others from the village all came to watch the performance and celebrate with us. A perfect Christmas in balmy Bali."),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v("\n      There are many villas to choose from in Bali. Beach, mountain, tourist spots, Ubud,..all are great.
