I rented the villa for our board meeting for two days in April 2016. One spacious living room was turned into a board room. Excellent lunches were served at the adjacent villa and dinner was set outside near the pool with beautiful decorations. The food was delicious with lots of use of ingredients from the local markets. The rooms are spacious with beautiful views on the valley. Prior to breakfast we had a great walk to the river with Pak Parta as our guide. He and his team were doing an excellent job in taking care of the guests. The tranquility of the place is ideal for any sort of retreat!
